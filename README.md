# HydraGen

HydraGen is a tool that allows generating a wide range of microservice benchmarks in a systematic and flexible way. This tool facilitates evaluating performance and scalability of various resource management strategies entailing microservice-based architectures hosted in cloud environments. Currently, HydraGen can generate benchmarks emulating web-based applications with HTTP or gRPC servers.
